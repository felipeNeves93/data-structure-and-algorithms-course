**What is a Stack?**

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- This means that the element that is added to the stack last is the first element to be removed.
- Stacks are often implemented using arrays or linked lists.

**Here are the most common operations performed on stacks:**

- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.

- **Pop:** Removes the element at the top of the stack and returns it.

- **Peek:** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

**Here is the Big O notation for the most common stack operations:**

- **Push:** *O(1)*
- **Pop:**    *O(1)*
- **Peek:**    *O(1)*
