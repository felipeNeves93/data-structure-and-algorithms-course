Implement a method called reverse() that reverses the order of the nodes in the list.


Method Signature:

public void reverse()


Output:

No explicit output is returned. However, the method should modify the doubly linked list such that the order of the nodes is reversed.


Constraints:

The doubly linked list may be empty or have one or more nodes.


Example:

Consider the following doubly linked list:

Head: 1
Tail: 5
Length: 5

Doubly Linked List:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5


After calling reverse(), the list should be:

Head: 5
Tail: 1
Length: 5

Doubly Linked List:
5 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1
