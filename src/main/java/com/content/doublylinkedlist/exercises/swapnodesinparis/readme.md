You are given a doubly linked list.

Implement a method called swapPairs within the class that swaps the values of adjacent nodes in the linked list. The method should not take any input parameters.

Note: This DoublyLinkedList does not have a tail pointer which will make the implementation easier.


Example:

1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4

should become

2 <-> 1 <-> 4 <-> 3


Your implementation should handle edge cases such as an empty linked list or a linked list with only one node.


Note: You must solve the problem WITHOUT MODIFYING THE VALUES in the list's nodes (i.e., only the nodes' prev and next pointers may be changed.)
