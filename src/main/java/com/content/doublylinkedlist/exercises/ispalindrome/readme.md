Write a method to determine whether a given doubly linked list reads the same forwards and backwards.

For example, if the list contains the values [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], then the method should return true, since the list is a palindrome.

If the list contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the method should return false, since the list is not a palindrome.

Method name: isPalindrome

Return Type: boolean
