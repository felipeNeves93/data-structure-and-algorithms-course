**What is quadratic growth ?**

An algorithm with O(n^2) complexity typically involves nested loops, where one loop iterates over the input elements, and another loop also iterates over the input elements (or a subset of them) for each iteration of the outer loop. This results in a growth rate that is proportional to the square of the input size.
