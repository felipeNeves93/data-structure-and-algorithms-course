**What is the O(1) complexity?**

O(1) specifically means that the worst-case time or resource usage
remains constant, regardless of the input size.

Algorithms with O(1) complexity perform a fixed
number of operations, often referred to as
"constant time operations," to complete their tasks. The number of operations doesn't change with the size of the input.
