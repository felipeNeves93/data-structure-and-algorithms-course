**What is Logarithmic growth?**

In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. The base of the logarithm determines the
logarithmic scale. When we say O(log n), we typically refer to the base-2 logarithm, denoted as log2(n).
This means that as the input size (n) increases, the algorithm's time
or space requirements grow much slower compared to linear growth (O(n)) or quadratic growth (O(n^2)).

In algorithms with O(log n) complexity, at each step or iteration, the problem size is typically divided in half or 
reduced significantly. This is why the growth is logarithmic. For example, in binary search, a common 
algorithm with O(log n) time complexity, you repeatedly divide the search space in half, reducing the number
of elements to consider.

O(log n) complexity is considered highly efficient because it allows you to handle significantly larger inputs with 
only a modest increase in resource usage or execution time. This efficiency is particularly important in situations 
where performance matters, such as in large-scale data processing or efficient searching and sorting algorithms.
