**What is Big(O) ?**

Big O notation is a mathematical way of describing the complexity of an algorithm. It is used to classify algorithms
according to how their
running time or space requirements grow as the input size increases.

**The main topics of big O notation are:**

- **Constant time:** An algorithm that takes a fixed amount of time to run, regardless of the input size.

- **Linear time:** An algorithm whose running time is proportional to the size of the input.

- **Quadratic time:** An algorithm whose running time is proportional to the square of the size of the input.

- **Exponential time:** An algorithm whose running time grows exponentially with the size of the input.
